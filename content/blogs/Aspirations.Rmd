During my path from begin a child to now becoming a young woman, I was always aspired by successful people, their lifestyle, their hard work and ability to push through even when it seems like there is no way out.

Among the people I looked up to I would distinguish Ruth Ginsburg:


# Joan Ruth Bader Ginsburg

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("/img/Ruth.png", error = FALSE)
```

She was an American lawyer and jurist who served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1993.

She is known for protecting women's rights, voting rights, abortion rights and other.
