<p>During my path from begin a child to now becoming a young woman, I was always aspired by successful people, their lifestyle, their hard work and ability to push through even when it seems like there is no way out.</p>
<p>Among the people I looked up to I would distinguish Ruth Ginsburg:</p>
<div id="joan-ruth-bader-ginsburg" class="section level1">
<h1>Joan Ruth Bader Ginsburg</h1>
<p><img src="/img/Ruth.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>She was an American lawyer and jurist who served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1993.</p>
<p>She is known for protecting womenâ€™s rights, voting rights, abortion rights and other.</p>
</div>
