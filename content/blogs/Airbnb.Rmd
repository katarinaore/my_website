In this article I will analyse data about Airbnb listings and fit a model to predict the total cost for two people staying 4 nights in an Airbnb in a city of Rio De Janeiro. 


```{r load_data, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=TRUE}

# use cache=TRUE so you dont donwload the data everytime you knit

listings <- vroom("http://data.insideairbnb.com/brazil/rj/rio-de-janeiro/2021-09-28/data/listings.csv.gz") %>% 
       clean_names()

```


Here is a quick description of some of the variables collected, and you can find a [data dictionary here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iWCNJcSutYqpULSQHlNyGInUvHg2BoUGoNRIGa6Szc4/edit#gid=982310896)

- `price` = cost per night 
- `property_type`: type of accommodation (House, Apartment, etc.)
- `room_type`:

  - Entire home/apt (guests have entire place to themselves)
  - Private room (Guests have private room to sleep, all other rooms shared)
  - Shared room (Guests sleep in room shared with others)

- `number_of_reviews`: Total number of reviews for the listing
- `review_scores_rating`: Average review score (0 - 100)
- `longitude` , `latitude`: geographical coordinates to help us locate the listing
- `neighbourhood*`: three variables on a few major neighbourhoods in each city 


# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In the [R4DS Exploratory Data Analysis chapter](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/exploratory-data-analysis.html){target="_blank"}, the authors state:


Let's conduct a thorough EDA by answering the following questions:

- How many variables/columns? How many rows/observations?
- Which variables are numbers?
- Which are categorical or *factor* variables (numeric or character variables with variables that have a fixed and known set of possible values?
- What are the correlations between variables? Does each scatterplot support a linear relationship between variables? Do any of the correlations appear to be conditional on the value of a categorical variable?


#Experimental Data Analysis for Rio De Janeiro Airbnb Data

#Let's look at first questions:

```{r}
# get summary stats
listings %>%
  skim()

# get summary stats
listings %>%
  str()

# if we try to run a histogram or boxplot or the likes, we will notice that price is discrete and thus not numeric. We will have to fix this should we continue to work with price.
  #ggplot(data=listings,aes(x=price))+
  #geom_histogram()

listings %>% 
  select(c(host_has_profile_pic, bedrooms, host_is_superhost, host_response_time, review_scores_rating, review_scores_cleanliness)) %>% 
  ggpairs(alpha = 0.3) +
  theme_bw()
```
### How many variables/columns? How many rows/observations? --> _SKIM_
Number of columns/ variables  74
Number of rows/ observations  23414 

### Which variables are numbers? --> _SKIM_
There are 37 variables that are numeric

### Are there any missing values to be concerned about? --> _SKIM_
Some variables have completion rates of only about 50%, which is something to keep in mind should we utilize functions that cut down the used data to only rows in which all data is available. However, most important numeric values, such as ratings, are there, as mainly descriptions are missing.

### Which are categorical or *factor* variables (numeric or character variables with variables that have a fixed and known set of possible values? --> _SKIM_
name, host_location, location, host_response_time, host_response_rate, host_acceptance_rate, host_is_superhost, host_neighbourhood, host verifications, host_has_profile_pic, host_identity_verified, property_type, room_type, amenities

### What are the correlations between variables? Does each scatterplot support a linear relationship between variables? Do any of the correlations appear to be conditional on the value of a categorical variable? --> _GGPAIRS_
There is a positive linear correlation between the cleanliness rating and the overall rating score. Other variables, such as number of bedrooms do not correlate with either cleanliness or overall ratings

### What are minimum, maximum, and average prices for a night? --> 
If we try to run a histogram or boxplot or the likes, we will notice that price is discrete and thus not numeric. We will have to fix this should we continue to work with price.


## Data wrangling

Once we load the data, it's always a good idea to use `glimpse` to see what kind of variables we have and what data type (`chr`, `num`, `logical`, `date`, etc) they are. 

Notice that some of the price data (`price`) is given as a character string, e.g., "$176.00"

Since `price` is a quantitative variable, we need to make sure it is stored as numeric data `num` in the dataframe. To do so, we will first use `readr::parse_number()` which drops any non-numeric characters before or after the first number

```{r}
listings <- listings %>% 
  mutate(price = parse_number(price))
```
  
I will use `typeof(listing$price)` to confirm that `price` is now stored as a number.

```{r}
typeof(listings$price)
```

#Double is a type of numeric value for R (to differentiate from integers), so it is working fine!

```{r}
# now, we can run the histogram and boxplot
price_histogram <- ggplot(data=listings,aes(x=price))+
  geom_histogram() +
  # define x scale to exclude outliers that would make the data unreadable
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0,1000)) +
  # add labels
  labs(title = 'Price distribution for Rio De Janeiro Airbnb accommodations', caption = "Source: Airbnb via data.insideairbnb.com", y = "", x="Price in USD", subtitle ="For accommodations within price range of 0 to 1000") +
  # make visuals nicer
  theme_bw() 

# create similar output for boxplot
price_boxplot <- ggplot(data=listings,aes(x=price))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  # define x scale to exclude outliers that would make the data unreadable
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0,1000))+
  # add labels
  labs(title = 'Price distribution for Rio De Janeiro Airbnb accommodations', caption = "Source: Airbnb via data.insideairbnb.com", y = "", x="Price in USD", subtitle ="For accommodations within price range of 0 to 1000") +
  # make visuals nicer
  theme_bw() 

# finally, print both plots neatly
price_histogram
price_boxplot
```

When excluding accommodations that apparently have daily prices of over USD 1,000 (some, according to the data, even have prices of about 20k USD!), it becomes obvious that the majority of accommodations are in the lower price range of USD 60 to USD 280, with a gradual decline in number of observations of places with increasing price from then on.


## Propery types

Next, we look at the variable `property_type`. We can use the `count` function to determine how many categories there are their frequency. What are the top 4 most common property types? What proportion of the total listings do they make up? 

```{r}
 # make sure proportions wont be shown in scientific notation
  options(scipen=999)

listings %>%
  # prepare the count by property type
  group_by(property_type) %>%
  count() %>%
  # arrange so categories with highest ns appear on top
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  # ungroup first
  ungroup(property_type) %>%
  # then add the proportion column
  mutate(proportion = n / sum(n))
```

We observe 86 categories of property types, as this is the number of rows of output. By far the most common type of accommodation is an entire rental unit, while private rooms inside rental units, entire condos, as well as private rooms in residential homes are the next most common places offered for you to stay in. Having a condo to yourself while exploring Rio sounds fun!


Since the vast majority of the observations in the data are one of the top four or five property types, we would like to create a simplified version of `property_type` variable that has 5 categories: the top four categories and `Other`. 

```{r}
listings <- listings %>%
  mutate(prop_type_simplified = case_when(
    property_type %in% c("Entire rental unit","Private room in rental unit", "Entire condominium (condo)","Private room in residential home") ~ property_type, 
    TRUE ~ "Other"
  ))
```


In the code below I will check that `prop_type_simplified` was correctly made:

```{r}
listings %>%
  count(property_type, prop_type_simplified) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) 
```


Airbnb is most commonly used for travel purposes, i.e., as an alternative to traditional hotels. We only want to include  listings in our regression analysis that are intended for travel purposes:

- What are the  most common values for the variable `minimum_nights`? 
- Is ther any value among the common values that stands out? 
- What is the likely intended purpose for Airbnb listings with this seemingly unusual value for `minimum_nights`?

I will also filter the airbnb data so that it only includes observations with `minimum_nights <= 4`


```{r}
listings_min_4_nights <- listings %>%
  filter(minimum_nights <= 4)
```

```{r}
# create the df to only include data with a minimum of 4 nights
listings_maxreq_4_nights <- listings %>%
  filter(minimum_nights <= 4)
```

        
# Mapping 

Visualisations of feature distributions and their relations are key to understanding a data set, and they can open up new lines of exploration. The following code shows a map of the city of Rio De Janeiro, and overlays all AirBnB coordinates to get an overview of the spatial distribution of AirBnB rentals. For this visualisation we use the `leaflet` package, which includes a variety of tools for interactive maps, so you can easily zoom in-out, click on a point to get the actual AirBnB listing for that specific point, etc.

The following code, having downloaded a dataframe `listings` with all AirbnB listings in Milan, will plot on the map all AirBnBs where `minimum_nights` is less than equal to four (4). 


```{r, out.width = '80%'}

leaflet(data = listings_maxreq_4_nights) %>%
  addProviderTiles("OpenStreetMap.Mapnik") %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(lng = ~longitude, 
                   lat = ~latitude, 
                   radius = 1, 
                   fillColor = "blue", 
                   fillOpacity = 0.4, 
                   popup = ~listing_url,
                   label = ~property_type)
```

    
# Regression Analysis

For the target variable $Y$, we will use the cost for two people to stay at an Airbnb location for four (4) nights. 

I will create a new variable called `price_4_nights` that uses `price`, and `accomodates` to calculate the total cost for two people to stay at the Airbnb property for 4 nights. This is the variable $Y$ we want to explain.

```{r}
 listings_maxreq_4_nights <- listings_maxreq_4_nights %>%
  # add new column that returns price if it can fit 2 people, otherwise return NA
  mutate(price_4_nights = ifelse(accommodates >=2, price, NA))
```


I will use histograms to examine the distributions of `price_4_nights` and `log(price_4_nights)`. 

```{r}
ggplot(data=listings_maxreq_4_nights, aes(x= price_4_nights)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0,1000)) +
  # add labels
  labs(title = 'Price distribution for Rio De Janeiro Airbnb accommodations', caption = "Source: Airbnb via data.insideairbnb.com", y = "", x="Price in USD", subtitle ="For places accommodating 2 or more people for 4 nights within price range of 0 to 1000") +
  # make visuals nicer
  theme_bw()

listings_maxreq_4_nights <- listings_maxreq_4_nights %>%
  mutate("log(price_4_nights)" = log(price_4_nights, ))

ggplot(data=listings_maxreq_4_nights, aes(x= log(price_4_nights))) +
  geom_histogram() +
  # add labels
  labs(title = 'ln Price distribution for Rio De Janeiro Airbnb accommodations', caption = "Source: Airbnb via data.insideairbnb.com", y = "", x="ln of Price in USD", subtitle ="For places accommodating 2 or more people for 4 nights within price range of 0 to 1000") +
  # make visuals nicer
  theme_bw()
```
```{r}
ggplot(data=listings_maxreq_4_nights, aes(x= price_4_nights)) +
  geom_density() +
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(0,1000)) +
  # add labels
  labs(title = 'Price distribution for Rio De Janeiro Airbnb accommodations', 
       caption = "Source: Airbnb via data.insideairbnb.com", 
       y = "", 
       x ="Price in USD", 
       subtitle ="For places accommodating 2 or more people for 4 nights within price range of 0 to 1000") +
  # make visuals nicer
  theme_bw()

listings_maxreq_4_nights <- listings_maxreq_4_nights %>%
  mutate("log(price_4_nights)" = log(price_4_nights,10))

ggplot(data=listings_maxreq_4_nights, aes(x= log(price_4_nights))) +
  geom_density() +
  # add labels
  labs(title = 'ln Price distribution for Rio De Janeiro Airbnb accommodations', 
       caption = "Source: Airbnb via data.insideairbnb.com", y = "", x="ln of Price in USD", 
       subtitle ="For places accommodating 2 or more people for 4 nights within price range of 0 to 1000") +
  # make visuals nicer
  theme_bw()
```

It's better to use the logarithm of price_4_nights for the regression, as logarithm transforms a skewed variable into a more normalized dataset. This way the variance of the dataset becomes constant and we could use simple linear regression for the estimation of this dataset.

I will now fit a regression model called `model1` with the following explanatory variables: `prop_type_simplified`, `number_of_reviews`, and `review_scores_rating`. 

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
model1 <- lm(log(price_4_nights) ~ prop_type_simplified + number_of_reviews + review_scores_rating, 
             data = listings_maxreq_4_nights)
mosaic::msummary(model1)
```


- Interpretation of the the coefficient `review_scores_rating` in terms of `price_4_nights`:
Absolute value of t-value is higher than 2, and p-value is below 5% (near zero, even), meaning we can be certain that the score is significant in explaining price. Statistically speaking and given by our current model, an increase in score by 1 unit should result in a decrease in log price by ~0.04. It seems logical that the true reason for this minor correlation could be because of a correlation of the score with other explanatory factors not considered in the model. This is supported by our model's adj. R-squared of only about 10%, meaning our entire model currently only manages to explain about 10% of the variation in price.


- Interpretation of the coefficient of `prop_type_simplified` in terms of `price_4_nights`:
We remind ourselves that the categorical regression does not contain the reference category (in our case, the Condo) since we only include K-1 categories. We instead now compare the other categories to the reference one. As such, the expected log price for the entire condo is 5.97. We cannot estimate about the entire rental unit, as both t- and p-value do not meet our required criteria. The "other" property type category is predicted to be 0.18 log prices lower than the entire condo, while the private room categories both have a more significantly lower expected log price. AS we can see, going with the log price for our analysis makes the final interpretation more difficult and less tangible.



We want to determine if `room_type` is a significant predictor of the cost for 4 nights, given everything else in the model. I will fit a regression model called model2 that includes all of the explanatory variables in `model1` plus `room_type`. 

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
model2 <- lm(log(price_4_nights) ~ room_type + prop_type_simplified + number_of_reviews + review_scores_rating, 
             data = listings_maxreq_4_nights)
mosaic::msummary(model2)
```

We can see that our initial categories became much less significant, with only the other property type category still fulfilling significance requirements. Our adj R^2 increased slightly to c. 15%. The room types seem to have stronger predictory power as the estimates are higher and two of the three categories have very strong t- and p-values. To conclude, however, it must be noted that the R^2 is still very low and the model does not have a lot of explanatory power. We should choose different variables!


## Further variables/questions to explore on our own

Let's extend the analysis by answering the following set of questions:

1. Are the number of `bathrooms`, `bedrooms`, `beds`, or size of the house (`accomodates`) significant predictors of `price_4_nights`? Or might these be co-linear variables?
```{r}
ggplot(data=listings_maxreq_4_nights, aes(y= price_4_nights, x= bathrooms)) +
  geom_point() +
  # add labels
  labs(title = 'Price distribution for Rio De Janeiro Airbnb accommodations', caption = "Source: Airbnb via data.insideairbnb.com", y = "Price in USD", x="Number of Bathrooms", subtitle ="For places accommodating 2 or more people for 4 nights within the price range of 0 to 1000") +
  # make visuals nicer
  theme_bw() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,1000)) 
  
ggplot(data=listings_maxreq_4_nights, aes(y= price_4_nights, x= bedrooms)) +
  geom_point() +
  # add labels
  labs(title = 'Price distribution for Rio De Janeiro Airbnb accommodations', caption = "Source: Airbnb via data.insideairbnb.com", y = "Price in USD", x="Number of Bedrooms", subtitle ="For places accommodating 2 or more people for 4 nights within the price range of 0 to 1000") +
  # make visuals nicer
  theme_bw() +
  geom_smooth()+
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,1000))+
  xlim(0,15)

ggplot(data=listings_maxreq_4_nights, aes(y= price_4_nights, x= beds)) +
  geom_point() +
  # add labels
  labs(title = 'Price distribution for Rio De Janeiro Airbnb accommodations', caption = "Source: Airbnb via data.insideairbnb.com", y = "Price in USD", x="Number of Beds", subtitle ="For places accommodating 2 or more people for 4 nights within the price range of 0 to 1000") +
  # make visuals nicer
  theme_bw() +
  geom_smooth()+
  scale_y_continuous(limits=c(0,1000)) +
  xlim(0,15)
```

1 - bathrooms:
We could clean bathrooms_text to return the number of bathrooms (since bathrooms is all NA). However, it would not deliver a meaningful result as some entries are for shared bathrooms, others for private ones. Since this additional information has further explanatory power, we would load our model with incoherent information.

2 - bedrooms:
There seems to be a positive correlation but there are a limited number of observations especially for higher numbers of bedrooms. Also, very high numbers of bedrooms seem to be cheaper again.

3 - beds:
The correlation between nubmer of beds and the price seems to be quite a bit weaker than when looking at bedrooms themselves. Do not use.




2. Do superhosts `(host_is_superhost`) command a pricing premium, after controlling for other variables?

```{r}
model3 <- lm(log(price_4_nights) ~ 
               prop_type_simplified + 
               number_of_reviews + 
               review_scores_rating + 
               room_type +
               host_is_superhost, 
             data = listings_maxreq_4_nights)
# print using the mosaic function
mosaic::msummary(model3)

```


T- and p-values tell us that the information about being a superhsot or not is in fact significant in explaining the variation in log price. After controlling for the given variables, it predicts a negative correlation of -0.07 in log price.


3. Some hosts allow you to immediately book their listing (`instant_bookable == TRUE`), while a non-trivial proportion don't. After controlling for other variables, is `instant_bookable` a significant predictor of `price_4_nights`?

```{r}
model4 <- lm(log(price_4_nights) ~ 
               prop_type_simplified + 
               number_of_reviews + 
               review_scores_rating + 
               room_type +
               host_is_superhost +
               instant_bookable, 
             data = listings_maxreq_4_nights)
# print using the mosaic function
mosaic::msummary(model4)

```

T- and p-values tell us that the information about allowing to isntantly book or not is in fact significant in explaining the variation in log price. After controlling for the given variables, it predicts a negative correlation of -0.12 in log price.



4. What is the effect of `avalability_30` or `reviews_per_month` on `price_4_nights`, after we control for other variables?

```{r}
model5 <- lm(log(price_4_nights) ~ 
               number_of_reviews + 
               review_scores_rating + 
               room_type +
               instant_bookable +
               availability_30 +
               reviews_per_month +
               bedrooms,
             data = listings_maxreq_4_nights)
# print using the mosaic function
mosaic::msummary(model5)
```


5. For all cities, there are 3 variables that relate to neighborhoods: `neighbourhood`, `neighbourhood_cleansed`, and `neighbourhood_group_cleansed`. There are typically more than 20 neighborhoods in each city, and it wouldn't make sense to include them all in your model. Use your city knowledge, or ask someone with city knowledge, and see whether you can group neighborhoods together so the majority of listings falls in fewer (5-6 max) geographical areas. You would thus need to create a new categorical variable `neighbourhood_simplified` and determine whether location is a predictor of `price_4_nights`


```{r}
filtered_listings_maxreq_4_nights <- listings_maxreq_4_nights %>%
  filter(neighbourhood_cleansed == c("Copacabana", "Jardim Botânico", "Barra da Tijuca", "Gávea", "Jacarepaguá"))

model6 <- lm(log(price_4_nights) ~ 
               number_of_reviews + 
               review_scores_rating + 
               room_type +
               instant_bookable +
               availability_30 +
               reviews_per_month +
               bedrooms +
               neighbourhood_cleansed,
             data = filtered_listings_maxreq_4_nights)
# print using the mosaic function
mosaic::msummary(model6)
```
Adding the neighbourhood variable increased the adj R^2 by about 5%, and 4 of the 5 neighbourhoods are statistically significant regarding both t- and p-values in explaining the variation in price. Interestingly, instant_bookable became insignificant, p- and t-values changed dramatically(!!!), meaning that it earlier seemed to be significant simply because of collinearity with truly explaining variables.



## Diagnostics, collinearity, summary tables

Not let us look at the model residuals:

1. Check the residuals, using `autoplot(model_x)`

```{r}
autoplot(model6)
```

We are good. The best-fit line is approximate to a constant 0, meaning that the variance of the residuals is homogeneously distributed. This satisfies the assumption of the OLS regression that we are using.


2. Now I will use `car::vif(model_x)`` to calculate the **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)** for my predictors and determine whether I have collinear variables. A general guideline is that a VIF larger than 5 or 10 is large, and the model may suffer from collinearity. Then it is best to remove the variable in question and run the model again without it.

```{r}
#car::vif(model6)
  alias(model6)
```



3. Let's create a summary table, using `huxtable` that shows which models we've worked on, which predictors are significant, the adjusted $R^2$, and the Residual Standard Error:

```{r}
huxreg(model1, model2, model3, model4, model5, model6)
```

We can observe a trend of increasing R^2 and decreasing Akaike Information Criterion when adding more and more variables to the model, as is expected. Of course, the heavily filtered $model6$ uses a far lower N of observations, making us a little bit more cautious about the results. Models 5 and 6 are both massive improvements over the first models that we tried out. These first models had low explanatory power in terms of R^2 even though controlling for many variables. The later models’ improved results stem from a better choice of variables.


4. Finally, I will use the best model we came up with for prediction. Suppose we are planning to visit Rio De Janeiro, and we want to stay in an Airbnb. We will find Airbnb in Rio that are apartments with a private room, have at least 10 reviews, and an average rating of at least 90. 
I will then use my best model to predict the total cost to stay at this Airbnb for 4 nights. 
I will also include the appropriate 95% interval with your prediction. Then I will report the point prediction and interval in terms of `price_4_nights`. 


We want to book the following accommodation: https://bit.ly/3lJM4eK
This costs GBP 33.00 (~USD 45.36) per night.
Let's use model6 to calculate the predicted price, as this model has the higher adj. R^2:

```{r}
predicted_price <- exp(5.147 - 0.001*15 - 0.035*5 - 0.297*1 - 0.009*1 + 0.011*0 - 0.029*1.25 + 0.464*1 - 0.263*1)
```
  
As we can see, our model predicts the price of BRL 123.439 which is equivalent to GBP 16.45 (using the exchange rate at the moment of calculation), whereas the real price is GBP 33. This is not the most precise prediction we could have obtained, but considering a relatively low R^2 of ~44%, this is still in an acceptable range, by the feeling of it.

```{r}

```
