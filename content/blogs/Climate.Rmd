# Climate change and temperature anomalies 


If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies you need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.

Run the code below to load the file:

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```

Notice that, when using this function, we added two options: `skip` and `na`.

1. The `skip=1` option is there as the real data table only starts in Row 2, so we need to skip one row. 
1. `na = "***"` option informs R how missing observations in the spreadsheet are coded. When looking at the spreadsheet, you can see that missing data is coded as "***". It is best to specify this here, as otherwise some of the data is not recognized as numeric data.

Once the data is loaded, notice that there is a object titled `weather` in the `Environment` panel. If you cannot see the panel (usually on the top-right), go to `Tools` > `Global Options` > `Pane Layout` and tick the checkbox next to `Environment`. Click on the `weather` object, and the dataframe will pop up on a seperate tab. Inspect the dataframe.

For each month and year, the dataframe shows the deviation of temperature from the normal (expected). Further the dataframe is in wide format. 

You have two objectives in this section:

1. Select the year and the twelve month variables from the `weather` dataset. We do not need the others (J-D, D-N, DJF, etc.) for this assignment. Hint: use `select()` function.

1. Convert the dataframe from wide to 'long' format. Hint: use `gather()` or `pivot_longer()` function. Name the new dataframe as `tidyweather`, name the variable containing the name of the month as `month`, and the temperature deviation values as `delta`.


```{r tidyweather}
tidyweather <-  weather %>%
  select(c(1:13)) %>% #selecting the relevant data
  pivot_longer(cols = 2:13, # pivotting columns 2 to 13
               names_to = "Month",
               values_to = "delta")
  
```

Inspect your dataframe. It should have three variables now, one each for 

1. year, 
1. month, and 
1. delta, or temperature deviation.

## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline. To do that, we first need to create a new variable called `date` in order to ensure that the `delta` values are plot chronologically. 


> In the following chunk of code, I used the `eval=FALSE` argument, which does not run a chunk of code; I did so that you can knit the document before tidying the data and creating a new dataframe `tidyweather`. When you actually want to run this code and knit your document, you must delete `eval=FALSE`, **not just here but in all chunks were `eval=FALSE` appears.**


```{r scatter_plot, eval=FALSE}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )

```

Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months? Use `facet_wrap()` to produce a seperate scatter plot for each month, again with a smoothing line. Your chart should human-readable labels; that is, each month should be labeled "Jan", "Feb", "Mar" (full or abbreviated month names are fine), not `1`, `2`, `3`. 

```{r facet_wrap, echo=FALSE}

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+ #defining the axis
  geom_point() + #creating a scatter plot based on the data
  facet_wrap(vars(Month)) + #producing separate plots for each month
  geom_smooth() #adding the smoothing line
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies by Month"
  )

```


It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as 1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. NASA calcuialtes a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base periof of 1951-1980. The code below creates a new data frame called `comparison` that groups data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present. 

We remove data before 1800 and before using `filter`. Then, we use the `mutate` function to create a new variable `interval` which contains information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign the different periods using `case_when()`.


```{r intervals, eval=FALSE}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```

Inspect the `comparison` dataframe by clicking on it in the `Environment` pane.

Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. Set `fill` to `interval` to group and colour the data by different time periods.

```{r density_plot, eval=FALSE}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density"         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )

```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using `group_by()` and `summarise()`, followed by a scatter plot to display the result. 

```{r averaging, eval=FALSE}
#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  summarise(mean_delta=mean(delta), # creating summaries for mean delta
            na.rm=TRUE)  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  
#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= mean_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_smooth() +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() + 

  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Anomaly",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  )
```


## Confidence Interval for `delta`

[NASA points out on their website](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php) that 

> A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.

Your task is to construct a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation with the `infer` package. Recall that the dataframe `comparison` has already grouped temperature anomalies according to time intervals; we are only interested in what is happening  between 2011-present.

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula, eval=FALSE}
formula_ci <- comparison %>% 
  
  # choose the interval 2011-present
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 
  filter(Year >= 2011) %>%
  na.omit() %>% #used to filter out N/A values

  # calculate summary statistics for temperature deviation (delta) 
  # calculate mean, SD, count, SE, lower/upper 95% CI
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 
  summarise(mean_delta=mean(delta), #calculating mean delta
            SD_delta=sd(delta), #calculating standard deviation
            count_delta=n(), #calculating n to be used in standard error calculation
            SE_delta=SD_delta/sqrt(count_delta), #calculating standard error
            lower_95_CI_delta=(mean_delta-1.96*SE_delta), #calculating lower 95% confidence interval
            upper_95_CI_delta=(mean_delta+1.96*SE_delta)) #calculating upper 95% confidence interval
  

#print out formula_CI
formula_ci
```


```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}
# use the infer package to construct a 95% CI for delta
library(infer)

set.seed(1234)

CI_using_bootstrap <- comparison %>% 
  filter(Year >= 2011) %>% # choose the interval 2011-present
  na.omit() %>% #used to filter out N/A values
  specify(response=delta) %>% # specifying that our variable of interest is delta
  generate(reps=10000, type='bootstrap') %>% #generating bootstrap samples
  get_confidence_interval(level=0.95, type="percentile") #calculating the confidence interval
  
CI_using_bootstrap
```

> What is the data showing us? Please type your answer after (and outside!) this blockquote. You have to explain what you have done, and the interpretation of the result. One paragraph max, please!

In the first case, we build the confidence interval manually using the formula, whereas we use the bootstrapping technique with 10,000 replications the second time around. We expected the two intervals to be closer to one another, as the bootstrapping technique produced a much wider range than the first one. At least, the first range is included and in the "middle" of the wider ranged produced by bootstrapping, giving us some further confidence that our technique is correct and that the 95% confidence is simply harder to achieve for our dataset using the bootstrapping technique.

# Global warming and political views (GSS)

[A 2010 Pew Research poll](https://www.pewresearch.org/2010/10/27/wide-partisan-divide-over-global-warming/) asked 1,306 Americans, "From what you've read and heard, is there solid evidence that the average temperature on earth has been getting warmer over the past few decades, or not?"


In this exercise we analyze whether there are any differences between the proportion of people who believe the earth is getting warmer and their political ideology. As usual, from the **survey sample data**, we will use the proportions to estimate values of *population parameters*. The file has 2253 observations on the following 2 variables:

- `party_or_ideology`: a factor (categorical) variable with levels Conservative Republican, Liberal Democrat, Mod/Cons Democrat, Mod/Lib Republican
- `response` : whether the respondent believes the earth is warming or not, or Don't know/ refuse to answer

```{r, read_global_warming_pew_data}
global_warming_pew <- read_csv(here::here("data", "global_warming_pew.csv"))
```

You will also notice that many responses should not be taken into consideration, like "No Answer", "Don't Know", "Not applicable", "Refused to Answer".


```{r}
global_warming_pew %>% 
  count(party_or_ideology, response)
```

We will be constructing three 95% confidence intervals to estimate population parameters, for the % who believe that **Earth is warming**, accoridng to their party or ideology. You can create the CIs using the formulas by hand, or use `prop.test()`-- just rememebr to exclude the Dont know / refuse to answer!

Does it appear that whether or not a respondent believes the earth is warming is independent of their party ideology? You may want to

# Biden's Approval Margins

As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data directly off fivethirtyeight website
approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

glimpse(approval_polllist)

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.

# Import approval polls data directly off fivethirtyeight website
approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

glimpse(approval_polllist)

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
approval_polllist <- approval_polllist %>% 
# Using mdy function to return data periods as integers for each of the columns 
  mutate(modeldate = mdy(modeldate), 
         startdate = mdy(startdate),
         enddate = mdy(enddate),
         createddate = mdy(createddate),
         timestamp = hms(timestamp))
# Look at the data frame
glimpse(approval_polllist)
# Look at the broad overview of the data frame
skim(approval_polllist)
```

## Create a plot

What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I want you plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.

Also, please add an orange line at zero. Your plot should look like this:

```{r trump_margins, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "biden_approval_margin.png"), error = FALSE)
```

```{r}
# Calculate the weekly net approval rate, along with sample size and standard deviation
approval_byweek <- approval_polllist %>%
  mutate(net_approval = approve - disapprove,
         week = week(enddate),
         year = year(enddate)) %>% 
  group_by(week) %>% 
  summarise(net_approval_mean = mean(net_approval),
            n = n(),
            sd = sd(net_approval))
```

```{r}
# Create the line plot with 95% confidence interval surrounding it
approval_byweek %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = net_approval_mean)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = net_approval_mean - qt(0.975,df = n-1)*sd/sqrt(n),
              ymax = net_approval_mean + qt(0.975, df = n-1)*sd/sqrt(n)),
              fill = 'grey95',color = 'orange') +
  geom_point(color = 'orangered') +
  geom_line(color = 'orange') +
  geom_smooth(se = F) +
  geom_line(aes(x=week,y=0),color = 'orange', size = 3) +
  labs(title = 'Estimating Approval Margin (approve - disapprove) for Joe Biden',
       x = 'Week of the Year',
       y = 'Average Approval Margin (Approve - Disapprove)',
       subtitle = "Weekly average of all polls") +
  geom_text(x= 23, y= 29, label= "2021", size = 3) +
  theme_bw()
  NULL
```


## Compare Confidence Intervals

Compare the confidence intervals for `week 3` and `week 25`. Can you explain what's going on? One paragraph would be enough.

In week 3 (7), the confidence interval is extremely wide, meaning that the variance of the responses was very high. Polls could have differed significantly across the spectrum. Our n is only 4, compared to a much higher n of about 50 in the following weeks. As we are adding a higher "uncertainty discount" to our confidence interval, this is directly reflected in the output. With few datapoints, it is hard to predict what range the true value must be in.


# Challenge 1: Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing

Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```



We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.

```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_distributions_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

Look at May and Jun and compare 2020 with the previous years. What's happening?

May and June of 2020 show unusually low levels of bike rentals throughout. This is most likely related to COVID-19, but without any further data, we cant say for sure and we dont want to bring our bias into the classroom, do we? Bastard.

However, the challenge I want you to work on is to reproduce the following two graphs.

```{r tfl_absolute_monthly_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to Q2 (weeks 14-26) and Q4 (weeks 40-52).

```{r tfl_percent_change, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_weekly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

For both of these graphs, you have to calculate the expected number of rentals per week or month between 2016-2019 and then, see how each week/month of 2020-2021 compares to the expected rentals. Think of the calculation `excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals`. 

Should you use the mean or the median to calculate your expected rentals? Why?

The median should be the better predictor for the practical forecasting application. The mean iseasily obscured by extreme values or outliers, and in an economic scenario we would most likely want to clean our prediction for that.

# Challenge 2: How has the CPI and its components changed over the last few years?

Remember how we used the tidyqant package to download CPI data. In this exercise, I would like you to do the following:

1. You can find [CPI components at  FRED](https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/public/datalist/843). You should adapt the code from German polls to scrape the FRED website and pull all of the CPI components into a vector. FIY, the list of components is the second table in that webpage.
1. Once you have a vector of components, you can then pass it to `tidyquant::tq_get(get = "economic.data", from =  "2000-01-01")` to get all data since January 1, 2000
1. Since the data you download is an index with various starting dates, you need to calculate the yearly, or 12-month change. To do this you need to use the `lag` function, and specifically, `year_change = value/lag(value, 12) - 1`; this means you are comparing the current month's value with that 12 months ago lag(value, 12).
1. I want you to order components so the higher the yearly change, the earlier does that component appear.
1. You should also make sure that the **All Items** CPI (CPIAUCSL) appears first.
1. Add a `geom_smooth()` for each component to get a sense of the overall trend.
1 You may want to colour the points according to whether yearly change was positive or negative. 

Having done this, you should get this graph.

```{r cpi_all_components_since_2016, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "cpi_components_since_2016.png"), error = FALSE)
```
```{r}
url <- "https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/public/datalist/843"


# get tables that exist on FRED website
tables <- url %>% 
  read_html() %>% 
  html_nodes(css="table")


# parse HTML tables into a dataframe called CPI 
# Use purr::map() to create a list of all tables in URL
CPI <- map(tables, . %>% 
             html_table(fill=TRUE) %>% 
             janitor::clean_names()) 

# Convert the list to a dataframe
CPI_df <- map_dfr(CPI, ~as.data.frame(.x)) 

# Create new dataframe with the data required for the task, ie series id
CPI_df <- CPI_df %>%
  summarise("series_id" = series_id, "title" = title) 

# Add the economics data to the dataframe starting from 2000-01-01

This graphs is fine, but perhaps has too many sub-categories. You can find the [relative importance of components in the Consumer Price Indexes: U.S. city average, December 2020](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/relative-importance/2020.htm) here. Can you choose a smaller subset of the components you have and only list the major categories (Housing, Transportation, Food and beverages, Medical care, Education and communication, Recreation, and Apparel), sorted according to their relative importance?

# Rubric

Check minus (1/5): Displays minimal effort. Doesn't complete all components. Code is poorly written and not documented. Uses the same type of plot for each graph, or doesn't use plots appropriate for the variables being analyzed. 

Check (3/5): Solid effort. Hits all the elements. No clear mistakes. Easy to follow (both the code and the output). 

Check plus (5/5): Finished all components of the assignment correctly and addressed both challenges. Code is well-documented (both self-documented and with additional comments as necessary). Used tidyverse, instead of base R. Graphs and tables are properly labelled. Analysis is clear and easy to follow, either because graphs are labeled clearly or you've written additional text to describe how you interpret the output.
