# Climate change and temperature anomalies 


If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the *Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies* in the Northern Hemisphere at [NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp). The [tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

To define temperature anomalies we need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.

Let us run the code below to load the file:

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v4/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```


Lets us first select the year and the twelve month variables from the `weather` dataset.

Then, let us convert the dataframe from wide to 'long' format and name the new dataframe as `tidyweather`, name the variable containing the name of the month as `month`, and the temperature deviation values as `delta`:


```{r tidyweather}
tidyweather <-  weather %>%
  select(c(1:13)) %>% #selecting the relevant data
  pivot_longer(cols = 2:13, # pivotting columns 2 to 13
               names_to = "Month",
               values_to = "delta")
  
```

The dataframe should have three variables now:

1. year, 
1. month, and 
1. delta, or temperature deviation.

## Plotting Information

Let us plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline:


```{r scatter_plot, eval=FALSE}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies"
  )

```

Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months? 

We will use `facet_wrap()` to produce a seperate scatter plot for each month: 

```{r facet_wrap, echo=FALSE}

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+ #defining the axis
  geom_point() + #creating a scatter plot based on the data
  facet_wrap(vars(Month)) + #producing separate plots for each month
  geom_smooth() #adding the smoothing line
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies by Month"
  )

```


It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. The code below creates a new data frame called `comparison` that groups data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present:


```{r intervals, eval=FALSE}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```


Now that we have the `interval` variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (`delta`), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in:

```{r density_plot, eval=FALSE}

ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density"         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )

```

So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies:

```{r averaging, eval=FALSE}
#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  summarise(mean_delta=mean(delta), # creating summaries for mean delta
            na.rm=TRUE)  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  
#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= mean_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_smooth() +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() + 

  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Anomaly",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta"
  )
```


## Confidence Interval for `delta`

Let us construct a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, both using a formula and using a bootstrap simulation with the `infer` package:

```{r, calculate_CI_using_formula, eval=FALSE}
formula_ci <- comparison %>% 
  
  # choose the interval 2011-present
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 
  filter(Year >= 2011) %>%
  na.omit() %>% #used to filter out N/A values

  # calculate summary statistics for temperature deviation (delta) 
  # calculate mean, SD, count, SE, lower/upper 95% CI
  # what dplyr verb will you use? 
  summarise(mean_delta=mean(delta), #calculating mean delta
            SD_delta=sd(delta), #calculating standard deviation
            count_delta=n(), #calculating n to be used in standard error calculation
            SE_delta=SD_delta/sqrt(count_delta), #calculating standard error
            lower_95_CI_delta=(mean_delta-1.96*SE_delta), #calculating lower 95% confidence interval
            upper_95_CI_delta=(mean_delta+1.96*SE_delta)) #calculating upper 95% confidence interval
  

#print out formula_CI
formula_ci
```


```{r, calculate_CI_using_bootstrap}
# use the infer package to construct a 95% CI for delta
library(infer)

set.seed(1234)

CI_using_bootstrap <- comparison %>% 
  filter(Year >= 2011) %>% # choose the interval 2011-present
  na.omit() %>% #used to filter out N/A values
  specify(response=delta) %>% # specifying that our variable of interest is delta
  generate(reps=10000, type='bootstrap') %>% #generating bootstrap samples
  get_confidence_interval(level=0.95, type="percentile") #calculating the confidence interval
  
CI_using_bootstrap
```

In the first case, we build the confidence interval manually using the formula, whereas we use the bootstrapping technique with 10,000 replications the second time around. We expected the two intervals to be closer to one another, as the bootstrapping technique produced a much wider range than the first one. At least, the first range is included and in the "middle" of the wider ranged produced by bootstrapping, giving us some further confidence that our technique is correct and that the 95% confidence is simply harder to achieve for our dataset using the bootstrapping technique.

# Global warming and political views (GSS)

Let us now analyze whether there are any differences between the proportion of people who believe the earth is getting warmer and their political ideology. As usual, from the **survey sample data**, we will use the proportions to estimate values of *population parameters*. The file has 2253 observations on the following 2 variables:

- `party_or_ideology`: a factor (categorical) variable with levels Conservative Republican, Liberal Democrat, Mod/Cons Democrat, Mod/Lib Republican
- `response` : whether the respondent believes the earth is warming or not, or Don't know/ refuse to answer

```{r, read_global_warming_pew_data}
global_warming_pew <- read_csv(here::here("data", "global_warming_pew.csv"))
```

You will also notice that many responses should not be taken into consideration, like "No Answer", "Don't Know", "Not applicable", "Refused to Answer".


```{r}
global_warming_pew %>% 
  count(party_or_ideology, response)
```

We will be constructing three 95% confidence intervals to estimate population parameters, for the % who believe that **Earth is warming**, accoridng to their party or ideology. You can create the CIs using the formulas by hand, or use `prop.test()`-- just rememebr to exclude the Dont know / refuse to answer!


```{r}
global_warming_filtered <- global_warming_pew %>% 
  filter(response!="Don't know / refuse to answer") %>%
  group_by(party_or_ideology) %>%
  summarise(count_warming=count(response=="Earth is warming"), count_not_warming=count(response=="Not warming"))

conservative_republican = c(global_warming_filtered[1,])
conservative_republican=conservative_republican[2:3]

liberal_democrat = c(global_warming_filtered[2,])
liberal_democrat=liberal_democrat[2:3]

mod_cons_democrat = c(global_warming_filtered[3,])
mod_cons_democrat=mod_cons_democrat[2:3]

mod_lib_republican= c(global_warming_filtered[4,])
mod_lib_republican[2:3]

conservative_republican_table <- do.call(rbind.data.frame, conservative_republican)

  prop.test(x = conservative_republican_table, p = NULL,
            alternative = "greater",
            conf.level= 0.95)
  
```



# Biden's Approval Margins


```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data directly off fivethirtyeight website
approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 


# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.

# Import approval polls data directly off fivethirtyeight website
approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

# Use `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
approval_polllist <- approval_polllist %>% 
# Using mdy function to return data periods as integers for each of the columns 
  mutate(modeldate = mdy(modeldate), 
         startdate = mdy(startdate),
         enddate = mdy(enddate),
         createddate = mdy(createddate),
         timestamp = hms(timestamp))

```

## Create a plot

Let us calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office.

```{r}
# Calculate the weekly net approval rate, along with sample size and standard deviation
approval_byweek <- approval_polllist %>%
  mutate(net_approval = approve - disapprove,
         week = week(enddate),
         year = year(enddate)) %>% 
  group_by(week) %>% 
  summarise(net_approval_mean = mean(net_approval),
            n = n(),
            sd = sd(net_approval))
```

```{r}
# Create the line plot with 95% confidence interval surrounding it
approval_byweek %>%  
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = net_approval_mean)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = net_approval_mean - qt(0.975,df = n-1)*sd/sqrt(n),
              ymax = net_approval_mean + qt(0.975, df = n-1)*sd/sqrt(n)),
              fill = 'grey95',color = 'orange') +
  geom_point(color = 'orangered') +
  geom_line(color = 'orange') +
  geom_smooth(se = F) +
  geom_line(aes(x=week,y=0),color = 'orange', size = 3) +
  labs(title = 'Estimating Approval Margin (approve - disapprove) for Joe Biden',
       x = 'Week of the Year',
       y = 'Average Approval Margin (Approve - Disapprove)',
       subtitle = "Weekly average of all polls") +
  geom_text(x= 23, y= 29, label= "2021", size = 3) +
  theme_bw()
  NULL
```


## Compare Confidence Intervals

Lwt us compare the confidence intervals for `week 3` and `week 25`.

In week 3 (7), the confidence interval is extremely wide, meaning that the variance of the responses was very high. Polls could have differed significantly across the spectrum. Our n is only 4, compared to a much higher n of about 50 in the following weeks. As we are adding a higher "uncertainty discount" to our confidence interval, this is directly reflected in the output. With few datapoints, it is hard to predict what range the true value must be in.


# Challenge 1: Excess rentals in TfL bike sharing

Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following:

```{r, get_tfl_data, cache=TRUE}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))

# Use read_excel to read it as dataframe
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))

# change dates to get year, month, and week
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```


We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.

```{r tfl_month_year_grid, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "tfl_distributions_monthly.png"), error = FALSE)
```

Look at May and Jun and compare 2020 with the previous years. 

May and June of 2020 show unusually low levels of bike rentals throughout. This is most likely related to COVID-19, but without any further data, we cant say for sure and we dont want to bring our bias into the classroom, do we?
